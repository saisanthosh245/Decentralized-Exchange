# Decentralised Exchange

## Project Description
The *Decentralised Exchange* is a smart contract-based prototype that allows users to add liquidity and perform token swaps between different token pairs. It simulates the core functionality of an automated market maker (AMM) with a simple pricing mechanism.

## Project Vision
To build a decentralized, trustless, and permissionless platform for token exchange that empowers users to trade without relying on centralized intermediaries.

## Key Features
- 🚀 *Liquidity Pool Management*: Add liquidity for token pairs.
- 🔄 *Token Swapping*: Swap one token for another using a basic algorithm.
- 📊 *Swap Rate Calculation*: Dynamically computes exchange rates based on available liquidity.

## Future Scope
- ✅ Integrate ERC20 token interface for actual token transfers.
- ✅ Use the Uniswap-style constant product formula (x * y = k) for pricing.
- ✅ Implement liquidity provider shares and rewards.
- ✅ Add slippage control and fee mechanism.
- ✅ Build a front-end with Web3.js or Ethers.js for user interaction.
